The latest release of [JCLI](https://code.dlang.org/packages/jcli) has been released, introducing a new feature, as we all as
partial `@safe, @nogc`, etc. markings.

## Changes

The following changes were implemented:

1. **Feature** - Added `populateActiveAnsiComponents` and `createAnsiCommandString` free-standing functions.
2. **Feature** - Most of `ansi.d` has now been made public, with a slight refactor in order to create a more user-friendly way of handling.
3. **[Feature](#textbuffer)** - Add `TextBuffer` and related types, as well as an example project for it.
4. **Feature** - Add `AnsiText.rawText` to get the raw string for an `AnsiText`.
5. **Tweak** - Most of the project is now marked `@safe`, other attributes such as `@nogc, nothrow, and pure` have been added where possible.
6. **Tweak** - [Silly](https://code.dlang.org/packages/silly) is now used as JCLI's test runner.
7. **Tweak** - `AnsiText` is slightly more efficient with caching.
8. **Fix** - Remove a stray `writeln` from `UserIO.log`

## TextBuffer

The main feature, which I spent way more time developing, is `TextBuffer`.

TextBuffer is an Ansi-enabled buffer of characters, exposed as a 2D grid of characters with associated Ansi data (foreground, background, and flags).

I was developing a (now scrapped) table component for JCLI, but was running into frustrations of having to handle the fact that Ansi strings contain
invisible characters, that are a bit annoying to measure.

So I thought: *"What if I make something that makes messing with Ansi text easier?"*, and thus, TextBuffer was born.

I'd like to point you over to its [example](https://github.com/BradleyChatha/jcli/tree/master/examples/07-text-buffer-table), 
and here's a screenshot of its output:

## Reminder

In the event that there's actually someone else other than me that uses this library, I'd just like to remind you that I'm completely
open to suggestions, criticism, PRs, etc.
