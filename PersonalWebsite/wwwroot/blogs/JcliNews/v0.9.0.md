The latest release of [JCLI](https://code.dlang.org/packages/jcli) has been released, mainly featuring new validation
capabilities for ArgBinder.

## Changelog

The following changes were implemented:

1. **Feature** - [Preliminary support for automatic Bash Completion](#bash-completion).
2. **Feature** - [Add ability for `ArgBinder` to also perform validation using user-provided UDAs](#argbinder-validation).
3. **Feature** - Add `asLineWrapped` as a lazy, range-based alternative to `lineWrap`.
4. **Improvement** - Improve `ArgBinder`'s compile-time debugging.
5. **Improvement** - The example tester has been improved.
6. **Change** - For better or for worse, `ArgPullParser` now allows named arguments to not actually have names.
7. **Tweak** - Improved `CommandLineInterface`'s internal structure.
8. **Fix** - Fix `UserIO.getInput`, it should actually compile now.
9. **Fix** - `HelpTextBuilderTechnical` should no longer output more new lines than needed.

## Bash Completion

JCLI now has intial support for providing Bash command line completion.

At the moment, there is no real user-facing customisation that is possible, but it's definitely something I'd like
to have in the future.

Here is an example of the bash completion, using the [JCLI Test Project](https://github.com/BradleyChatha/jcli_testerr):

![Bash Completion example](/img/blogs/jcli/v090_jcli_bash.webp)

This particular example uses the `eval` command to interpet the bash completion script, but you can use whatever mechanism is
best for you to enable completion.

The script for any program can be obtained by passing `__jcli:bash_complete_script` as the command name to any JCLI program.

## ArgBinder Validation

The `ArgBinder` can now also perform validation, both on the input string as well as the final bound output.

While [the example](https://github.com/BradleyChatha/jcli/blob/master/examples/08-arg-binder-validation/source/commands.d)
shows you basic usage (when using `CommandLineInterface` as your core), the TLDR is:

* Create a struct with either or both of these signatures:

```d
// This can be templated as well :)
bool onValidate(AnyTypeYouWant boundOutput, ref string error);
bool onPreValidate(string inputString, ref string error);
```

* On error, return `false` and populate the `error` string, otherwise return `true` on success.

* Attach your struct as a UDA onto any `@CommandPositionalArg` or `@CommandNamedArg`, and `CommandLineInterface` will handle the rest.

* ???

* Validation, baby.

If a validator cannot be used with the argument it's attached to, then `ArgBinder` will silenty pass over it.

If you want `ArgBinder` to throw compiler errors when instead of ignoring things, such as for figuring out **why** it happens, 
then define the `JCLI_BinderCompilerErrors` version.
