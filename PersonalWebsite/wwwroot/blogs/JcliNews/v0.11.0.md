The latest release of [JCLI](https://code.dlang.org/packages/jcli) has been released, featuring a massive amount of changes,
tweaks, features, and a brand new comprehensive README.

Special thanks to [andrey-zherikov](https://github.com/andrey-zherikov) for all of the support he's provided.

## Changelog

The following changes were implemented:

1. **README** - A new comprehensive README has been created, which is 37,463(NOT FINAL VALUE, UPDATE THIS FUTURE ME) characters long.
1. **Breaking** - The `@CommandDefault` UDA has been introduced. The old way of making default commands is now deprecated.
1. **Breaking** - Arg binders now have to use the new `Result` type.
1. **Feature** - The `@CommandArgGroup` UDA has been introduced, allowing arguments to be organised into groups within a command's help text.
1. **Feature** - The `@ArgValidator` UDA has been introduced for user-defined, argument-specific validation.
1. **Feature** - Settings can now be passed into CommandLineInterface, including an app name to show within error and help text.
1. **Feature** - Introduced a `Result` type.
1. **Feature** - Added the top-level package `jcli` that publically imports `jaster.cli`.
1. **Feature** - Add built-in validators `@PreValidate` and `@PostValidate`, allowing a more fluent but limited style of validation.
1. **Feature** - The `@ArgBindWith` UDA has been introduced, so that specific arguments can be bound in a specific way.
1. **Feature** - Introduce the `CommandArgAction` enum, which allows customisation of how an argument is parsed. Currently `.default_` and `.count`.
1. **Change** - Bash completion is now opt-in, and JCLI no longer requires the `-J` flag for non-dub users.
1. **Change** - Version JCLI_BinderCompilerErrors has been removed as the ArgBinder will no longer mask compiler errors.
1. **Change** - Github Actions now triggers on pull requests, and uses the official dlang action.
1. **Change** - Detection of multiple default commands has moved to a compile-time check, instead of a runtime one.
1. **Change** - Failure to find an appropriate binder in `ArgBinder.bind` now creates a compile-time error, instead of a runtime one.
1. **Tweak** - core.d has been restructured (again).
1. **Tweak** - binder.d has been restructured.
1. **Tweak** - Unnamed positional arguments are given the default name of "VALUE" instead of being invisible.
1. **Tweak** - The usage string has been changed into a more standard format.
1. **Tweak** - Most error messages and help texts have been improved.
