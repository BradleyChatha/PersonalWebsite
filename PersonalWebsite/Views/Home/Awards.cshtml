            My <a href="#">FarmMaster</a> project was nominated by Aim Educational Ltd for the School Farm Network's
            <em>'Best use of the school curriculum'</em> award.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project was short listed, and moved to be nominated for the
            <em>'Innovative or Inspirational project'</em> award, where it then won
            first place.
